As you can see, there are many rough edges, but this wa my first
Angular/Flask/Bootstrap APP so cut me some slack.  Here are some things that
need doing.  Also, there are TODO notes in the source:

Most important:
- ADD ERROR HANDLING OF ANY KIND
- Tests?
- Decide if flattening the sources for the data model makes sense
- What happens if you select things that then vanish?
- Add spinners for clicks
- Handle reGather better

Nice to have:
- Fix collapsing sections logic
    - Only collapse collectors
    - Add twisty arrows for cues
- Try to keep blacklists variable sane throughout
- Better manage multiple value fields
- Add bulk checkbox select
    - Enable ability to only update certain fields
- Add collector settings too
- Make collectors filter work on more than just name
- Sources panel should respond as selections are made. Possible?
- Try to make less Sumo calls
- Add Are you sure modal back into the flow
- Header layout sucks and doesn't respond well
